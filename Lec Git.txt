A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. 
The default branch name in Git is master. As you start making commits, you’re given
 a master branch that points to the last
 commit you made. Every time you commit, the master branch pointer moves forward
 automatically.


Creating a New Branch
What happens when you create a new branch? Well, doing 
so creates a new pointer for you to move around.
 Let’s say you want to create a new branch called testing.
 You do this with the git branch command:
---------------------------------------------------
git remote -v
git remote add origin https://github.com/AdnanKhan01/Test.git
git remote -v
git push -u main
go to github change a file and then pull. You'll see the local repository will update itself
git pull origin  https://github.com/AdnanKhan01/Test.git
